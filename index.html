        <h3><u>Abstract:</u></h3>
        <p>This comprehensive essay delves into and intends to answer the fascinating question as to whether it is possible for anything to escape a black hole - be it a physical and visible object or a small subatomic particle, such as a photon. Drawing upon scientific research, observational data, and theoretical models derived from our existing exploration of this topic, this essay enquires about the nature of black holes and how their gravitational force performs. By critically scrutinising our current scientific understanding, thanks to the work of Einstein, Hawking, Chandrasekhar et al, I will endeavour to depict both sides of the argument; of whether escape from a black hole is truly possible. I will also attempt to provide insights into potential avenues for freedom from black holes by touching upon topics such as the famous Hawking Radiation, as well as traversable wormholes accompanied by exotic matter. By making my essay as least biased as possible, by also exploring why the probability of escape may be low, I hope to truly educate my readers and pique their interest in this field by calling forth a topic of little popularity.</p>
        
        <h3><u>Introduction:</u></h3>
        <p>We, as simple minded human beings, define escaping as the ability to ‘break free from confinement or control’<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=escape+definition&sca_esv=78fec654521ada59&sca_upv=1&sxsrf=ADLYWIKC9wmJrPCJ7DJ8lFfTjLgzgbFywQ%3A1725900660601&ei=dCffZqu3JKLPhbIPpLmo4Qs&oq=escape+def&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAaAhgCIgplc2NhcGUgZGVmKgIIADIQEAAYgAQYkQIYigUYRhj5ATILEAAYgAQYkQIYigUyCxAAGIAEGJECGIoFMgoQABiABBgUGIcCMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMioQABiABBiRAhiKBRhGGPkBGJcFGIwFGN0EGEYY-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&sclient=gws-wiz-serp"><small><em>(Languages, 2023)</em></small></a>, but what if things could escape in ways we could not even begin to imagine? Most people know, or are at least somewhat aware of the typical fact, that nothing can escape a black hole; it is absurd to even think otherwise, their gravitational pull is far too strong. But, what if black holes are not as imprisoning as you may think?</p>
        
        <h3><u>1.1 History of Black Holes:</u></h3>
        <p>Originally known as ‘frozen stars’, due to ‘a quirk in relativity that makes time appear to slow down in a gravitational field’ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/27/science/black-hole-names-holley-bockelmann.html"><small><em>(Overbye, 2021)</em></small></a>​, they are amongst the most captivating and incomprehensible objects in our universe. Now famously coined ‘black holes’ by John A. Wheeler, the phenomenon was first theorised in 1783 by John Michell, an English country parson, who referred to them as ‘dark stars’ in his paper to Henry Cavendish <a href="https://royalsociety.org/blog/2019/06/black-holes/"><small><em>(Michell, 1783)</em></small></a>. Michell was in acceptance of Newton’s Corpuscular Theory of Light; the postulation that ‘light is made up of tiny particles called ‘corpuscles’ having negligible mass’ <a href="https://www.physics-and-radio-electronics.com/blog/corpuscular-theory-light/"><small><em>​(Shaik, 2016)</em></small></a>​ and thus he concluded that the gravity of a celestial object would have to be so strong for its escape velocity – which in celestial mechanics is ‘the velocity needed for a body to escape from a gravitational centre of attraction without undergoing any further acceleration’ <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/escape-velocity"><small><em>​(The Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2021)</em></small></a>​ – to exceed the speed of light. Therefore, meaning that the ‘light would have to fall back to the surface’3 making it appear invisible. However, Michell was far ahead of his time, so his idea did not leave much of an impression on his scientific contemporaries; thus, not being credited much for his ideation of black holes in this day and age.</p>

        <h3><u>1.2 Theory of General Relativity:</u></h3>
        <p>Despite fathering this revolutionary idea, it was Karl Schwarzschild who first discovered the ground-breaking answer to Albert Einstein’s famous field equations, which were first published in his Theory of Relativity paper, under the assumption of spherical symmetry <a href="https://hepweb.ucsd.edu/ph110b/110b_notes/node75.html"><small><em>(Branson, 2012)</em></small></a> - a geometric property in which an object is symmetric under rotations around a fixed point, having properties independent of latitude and longitude; properties that depend only on radial distance ​<a href="https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Spherical_symmetry"><small><em>(Spherical symmetry - Glossary of Meteorology, 2012)</em></small></a>​. </p>
        <img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*xmwb3PtcCMhBLDxl.png" alt="Equation 1: Einstein's Field Equation." width="400px" class="images">
        <a href="https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol6-trans/110" class="centerlink"><small><em>Equation 1: Einstein's Field Equation. (Einstein, 1915)</em></small></a>
        <br>
        <p>Albert Einstein’s remarkable Theory of General Relativity is the understanding and explanation of how the unique fabric of space-time, which is the concept that time and space is interwoven into a single continuum, is affected by gravity and was published in 1915. 10 years previously, he had another theory published; the Theory of Special Relativity which argued that space and time are inexorably intertwined, however, this first theory did not take into account the effects of gravity much like Einstein’s second, which is somewhat a sequel and expansion to Special Relativity. Einstein determined that space-time is warped by particularly large objects and this contortion manifests itself as the force of gravity. For example, if you placed a large heavy object, such as a bowling ball, in the middle of a trampoline and made an attempt to roll a marble around the edge of it, you would make the observation that the marble spirals inwards towards the ball – due to the dimple it causes in the fabric of the trampoline <a href="https://www.space.com/17661-theory-general-relativity.html"><small><em>​(Giorgi, 2022)</em></small></a>​, a similar thing happens with black holes and the incredible material of space-time.</p>

        <p>As there was no basis for Einstein to be religiously, morally or scientifically biased, it was assumed he was not and thus the majority of theoretical scientists were quick to accept his notions; and rightfully so as tests have been conducted against existing knowledge we have of black holes and everything seems to be in accordance with Einstein’s ideations – for example, the tests conducted on the Messier 87*.</p>
        <p>In 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration published the first image of the galaxy Messier 87, otherwise known as M87, with a black hole in its centre – the M87*. The data from the black hole was analysed at Goethe Universität Frankfurt, in Germany, by a team of physicists in order to put Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity to the test. According to the results, the proportions of the M87*’s shadows was in complete and ‘excellent agreement with a black hole predicted by general relativity’ <a href="https://eventhorizontelescope.org/einsteins-theory-can-explain-black-hole-m87"><small><em>​(Goethe Universität Frankfurt, 2021)</em></small></a>​.</p>
        <p>With such ambiguity surrounding the actual nature of black holes, it is difficult to verify what they are genuinely capable of; as well as their true properties. This essay aims to address the enigmatic matter and question of whether anything can escape a black hole or not; if the answer is no then why, and if yes, how – if there is even possibility for such an answer.</p>
        
        <h3><u>1.3 Basics of Black Holes:</u></h3>
        <p>The discovery of black holes was one of the most significant turning points for physicists in the astronomy field and to this very day they remain the most inexplicable stellar discovery because they challenge the fundamental laws of physics, making experts rethink everything. But what even are black holes?</p>
        <p>Black holes are thought to be the most astonishing astrophysical entities which are typically characterised by their immense gravitational force - due to the amount of matter tightly condensed in such a small space - that not even the fastest known entity in our universe, light, which can reach up to the universal speed limit of 300,000 kilometres per second <a href="https://www.amnh.org/explore/ology/physics/train-of-thought2/light-speed#:~:text=Light%20is%20fast!,can%20seem%20to%20appear%20instantaneously"><small><em>(American Museum of Natural History, 2023)</em></small></a>​​, can escape it’s clutch. However, ‘the possibility that gravity can become so strong that it does not even allow light to escape had already existed in Newtonian gravity’​ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmlrW3DTysA"><small><em>(Hossenfelder, 2020)</em></small></a>​. Due to this twisted and distorted region of space-time, it is rendered invisible to conventional telescopic observations. Generally divided into three categories: stellar-mass, supermassive and intermediate-mass, astronomers suspect that a fourth type may exist – primordial blackholes formed during the ultimate birth of the universe <a href="https://universe.nasa.gov/black-holes/types/"><small><em>​(NASA Science, 2023)</em></small></a>​. Although it is the stellar black hole which is the most recurrent of them all <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-is-a-black-hole-58.html"><small><em>(NASA, 2014)</em></small></a>.</p>

        <p>Most stellar black holes are formed due to the collapsing of massive stars, such as a carbon-oxygen white dwarf, which results in a supernova explosion <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-is-a-black-hole-58.html"><small><em>​(NASA, 2014)</em></small></a>​ and it was John Archibald Wheeler, an American theoretical physicist, who made the compelling argument - alongside his students - that massive stars must form black holes <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009APS..APR.B5002T/abstract#:~:text=Wheeler%20and%20his%20students%20showed,including%20Jacob%20Bekenstein's%20black%2Dhole"><small><em>​(Thorne, 2009)</em></small></a>​. This explosion is a catastrophic and energetic gravitational collapse, occurring when a large star exhausts itself of its nuclear fuel and it is only when the star reaches the Chandrasekhar Limit, the maximum mass theoretically possible for a stable white dwarf star <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Chandrasekhar-limit"><small><em>​(The Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2023)</em></small></a>​, that a supernova occurs and the star explodes. There are two types of supernovae – a core collapse supernova and a thermal runaway supernova, however, it is the core collapse supernova which is thought to cause most black holes in the final stages of life for stars that are ‘at least eight times larger than our Sun’ <a href="https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainssupernovae"><small><em>​(Department of Energy, 2023)</em></small></a>​. Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar was an American-Indian and one of the most foremost theoretical astrophysicists of the twentieth century. Chandrasekhar, who was also a professor at the University of Chicago, took one of the first steps towards the discovery of black holes – he figured out that once these stars run out of fuel they would have to collapse <a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/the-day-tomorrow-began/black-holes#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20first%20steps,they%20ran%20out%20of%20fuel"><small><em>​(News, 2023)</em></small></a>​ when he was only 19 years old. When the Chandrasekhar Limit was first formulated in 1930, it was highly opposed as scientists of the time feared legitimizing the existence of black holes, insisting they were too unrealistic. The famous Indian physicist stood by his beliefs and stated that ‘a star having a mass more than 1.44 times that of the Sun does not form a white dwarf but instead continues to collapse’ <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Subrahmanyan-Chandrasekhar"><small><em>(The Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2023)</em></small></a>. However, as soon as eminent and reputable physicists such as Stephen Hawking and Wilhelm Anderson accepted Chandrasekhar’s proposition, many followed in their footsteps and decided to adopt the idea too. Although, technically anything could become a black hole – even a human being. This is due to something known as the Schwarzschild Radius.</p>
        <p>The Schwarzschild Radius is ‘the radius of the event horizon surrounding a non-rotating black hole’ <a href="https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/S/Schwarzschild+Radius"><small><em>​(Swinburne University of Technology, 2023)</em></small></a>​ and is calculated by the formula:</p>
        <img src="https://www.perthobservatory.com.au/wp-content/uploads/schwarzschild-radius-mathematical-equation.jpg" alt="Equation 2: Schwarzschild Radius Formula" width="300px" height="200px" class="images">
        <small style="text-align: center; display: block;"><em>Equation 2: Schwarzschild Radius Formula</em></small>
        <p>Where ‘R’ represents the Schwarzschild Radius, ‘G’ representing gravitational constant, ‘M’ being the mass, and ‘c’ representing the speed of light. Every object in our Universe is assigned a Schwarzschild Radius whereby gravity starts to behave unusually within it. In theory, what this concept and equation actually finds out, is how small an object needs to be compressed in order for its gravitational force to become so strong that not even the most fast moving entities of our universe can escape it – an idea which practically defines black holes. For instance, the Schwarzschild Radius of the Sun is 3.0 × 103 m, or 3km, and for the Earth it is 8.7mm7, meaning that if the Earth got compacted down to smaller than the size of an average marble it would transform into a black hole. In most scenarios, the Schwarzschild Radius of the object is a notable decrease in size, compared to the mass and initial size of said object.</p>

        <h3><u>1.4 Event Horizon:</u></h3>
        <p>Black holes have many enthralling attributes; one being the event horizon, which is a quintessential feature that ‘effectively hides the singularity at the centre of a black hole’ <a href="https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/e/Event+Horizon"><small><em>​(Swinburne University of Technology, 2023)​</em></small></a>  beyond which nothing can escape due to its monumental gravitational pull and it is in fact the event horizon which puts the ‘no escape’ paradigm of a black hole into action. Defined by the Schwarzschild Radius, the theoretical boundary is a fundamental concept in the theory of relativity and marks the point of no return for objects or information falling into the black hole because once an object enters the event horizon, its trajectory is directed towards the singularity of the vast celestial being. As you get closer to the black hole, from an outside viewer, it would seem as though time around it has completely halted and according to Einstein's Theory of Relativity, time and space almost trade positions <a href="https://lweb.cfa.harvard.edu/seuforum/bh_whatare.htm"><small><em>(Universe Forum, 2009)</em></small></a> , which is why this theory can be summarised by these 12 words: ‘Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.’ <a href="https://archive.org/details/geonsblackholesq00whee"><small><em>​(Wheeler, 1998)</em></small></a>. This is due to the fact that any massive body produces such an effect which makes it seem as though time has slowed or come to a pause, e.g. the Earth, but due to its gargantuan mass, this effect appears incredibly more obvious on the space-time surrounding a black hole.</p>
        <p>At the center of every black hole is a point of infinite density known as the ‘singularity’. This is where matter is compressed into an extremely small and dense state whereby everything crossing the spherical boundary, known as the event horizon, is irretrievably drawn towards. It is a point in which time and space have merged into one reality and have no discernible meaning, making all physical laws indistinguishable from one another <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/84147/singularity/"><small><em>(Universe Today, 2017)</em></small></a>. This notion exists in the Theory of Relativity as it is believed that the universe began in an initial moment of singularity <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-einstein-s-theory-of-gravity-hold-near-black-holes/#:~:text=The%20theory%20also%20tells%20us,center%20of%20every%20black%20hole.&text=In%20a%20black%20hole%2C%20the,the%20singularity%20from%20our%20universe"><small><em>(Psaltis & Doeleman, 2015)</em></small></a> where the rules that govern matter are broken down. Although the points of singularity in black holes are always concealed by their event horizon, general relativity doesn’t necessarily require for the singularity to be shrouded - though this idea of a ‘naked’ singularity is highly theoretical and has not yet been proven to exist. Furthermore, according to the Penrose Singularity Theorem, stipulating that ‘there is a gravitational singularity in every black hole, forming at the same time as the event horizon’ <a href="https://www.einstein-online.info/en/spotlight/the-singularity-theorem/"><small><em>​(Malek, 2020)​</em></small></a>, the singularities only occur within a black hole when the matter within reaches a specific energy circumstance <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.5226"><small><em>(Penrose, 1965)</em></small></a>​. This theorem is based on the idea of Einstein’s General Relativity and was proposed by Roger Penrose, a British mathematical physicists who has made many significant contributions to today’s knowledge of black holes. His conjecture demonstrates that singularities, curvature and positions of infinite density are generic features for particular solutions of the theory. Much more specifically, the theorem conveys that singularities, under fixed conditions such as in the gravitational subsidence of a massive star, are inexplicable. Nevertheless, it is essential to note that this aforementioned concept is currently an active area of research and so is not fully explainable or comprehensible with our existing knowledge of black holes.</p>

        <h3><u>1.5 Information Paradox:</u></h3>
        <p>Black holes are peculiar, they all have the same structure and measurable units: electric charge, rotation and mass. Amalgamate enough hydrogen and helium and you are left with a star; but throw combine some water, spices, and sugar and you will still end up with the same black hole as one made of purely hydrogen. This is due to something known as the ‘no-hair’ theorem relating to the information paradox which was first introduced due to quantum theory maxim that states information cannot ever be lost due to the ‘no-deletion’ theorem <a href="https://phys.org/news/2011-03-quantum-no-hiding-theorem-experimentally.html"><small><em>(Zyga, 2011)</em></small></a>. Thanks to Stephen Hawking, who established that a black hole's event horizon might not be as restrictive as we had believed prior to the suggestion of Hawking Radiation, scientists have one exposition to this paradox. This is because the data of the matter that falls into the black hole must be emitted from the black hole in the form of light - Hawking Radiation – ergo information is never destroyed.</p>

        <h3><u>1.5 Hawking Radiation:</u></h3>
        <p>One of the most widely proposed mechanisms for escape of a black hole is Hawking radiation - a theoretical prediction proposed by Stephen Hawking, in 1974. According to quantum field theory and quantum mechanical principles, vacuum fluctuations, otherwise known as quantum fluctuations, are the emergence and annihilation of pairs of particles and antiparticles in empty space. Quantum field theory shows us space that is seemingly empty is, in actuality, saturated with fluctuations of light and matter fields which leads to a continual appearance and disappearance of photons and other particles. These miniscule shifts - or fluctuations - of the spectral lines of atoms can cause the complete evaporation of black holes. Typically, these antiparticles would completely exterminate each other instantly which would have zero impact on the net environment, however, Hawking’s insight was that a process would occur on the pair of particles, ‘one of which escaping at infinity while the other is trapped inside the black hole horizon’ <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Hawking_radiation"><small><em>(Spindel, 2011)</em></small></a> due to the abnormal gravitational effects of the event horizon. This is the foundational idea of Hawking radiation, if one of the particles of the pair falls into the black hole whilst the other escapes, it will appear as though radiation is being emitted – thus technically some form of matter is in actuality ‘escaping’ the black hole. Hawking radiation is significant when referencing black holes as it suggests they are not actually black, but rather they emit a faint form of radiation which would consist of photons and other atoms such as ‘fiercely energetic particles, antiparticles and gamma rays’ <a href="https://jila.colorado.edu/~ajsh/bh/hawk.html#:~:text=The%20Hawking%20radiation%20itself%20would,might%20look%20like%20a%20dud"><small><em>​(Boulder, 1998)​</em></small></a>​. A photon could take many possible paths in an attempt to escape the event horizon, and an extensive majority of these lead the particle down into the black hole's singularity. Although rare, it is possible for the photon to travel perfectly perpendicular to the event horizon, which would then give it a chance to escape the dark depths of the extraterrestrial entity.</p>
        <p>This radiation, according to Hawking, is completely random and contains no information about the black hole's contents. As the black hole fades away, so does the universe's record of everything that went inside, although this infringes a principle dubbed ‘unitarity’, which holds that as particles interact with one another, information about them is never lost and always conserved, only scrambled, meaning that if the direction of time in the universe's quantum evolution were to be reversed, things would unscramble into a perfect re-creation of the past <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/newfound-wormhole-allows-information-to-escape-black-holes-20171023/"><small><em>(Wolchover, 2018)</em></small></a>​(Wolchover, 2018)​. Furthermore, this radiation - or thermal energy - insinuates that black holes have a temperature, which is ‘inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole and the size of the event horizon’ <a href="https://phys.org/news/2016-09-cold-black-holes.html#:~:text=The%20temperature%20of%20the%20black%20hole%20is%20inversely%20proportional%20to,size%20of%20the%20event%20horizon"><small><em>(Cain, 2016)</em></small></a>, and can gradually lose mass and energy eventually as it evaporates. This denotes that technically the smaller the black hole is, the hotter it should glow; due to an attribute which physicists like to call entropy, which is ‘a measure of disorder of the system <a href="ttps://openstax.org/books/physics/pages/12-3-second-law-of-thermodynamics-entropy#:~:text=Entropy%20is%20a%20measure%20of,is%20available%20to%20do%20work"><small><em>(OpenStax, 2020)</em></small></a>, occurring when matter enters a black hole and is forcibly imprisoned. It was in fact Jacob Bekenstein, a physics student from Princeston in the United States, that made this remarkable link between the surface area of the event horizon and the entropy. He had the conviction that the event horizon’s surface area should increase as matter enters the black hole and demonstrated how this area symbolizes the measure of entropy that might otherwise be lost, suggesting a remedy for the paradox. Hawking was not in agreement – entropy was thermal energy, emitting radiation meaning the black hole should in some form glow, but that would mean black holes are not so black after all. In an effort to disprove Bekenstein’s theory, he instead authenticated the statement. However, it is vital to note that Hawking radiations lies on two wavering conjectures: that typical physics is applicable to ‘vacuum fluctuations at energy scales increasing exponentially without bound’; and that ‘quantum-gravitational effects may be neglected’ ​(Hefler, 2003)​. This means the prominently proposed theory suggested by Stephen Hawking is incredibly weak for astrophysical black holes – making it practically undetectable. Nonetheless, the experimental confirmation of Hawking radiation continues to remain elusive, and therefore it is, in present time, an ongoing area of theoretical and experimental physics research.</p>

        <h3><u>1.6 Traversable Wormholes and Exotic Matter:</u></h3>
        <p>A more recent idea has been birthed amongst physicists which introduces possibilities for escape routes from black holes through traversable wormholes. Traversable wormholes are conjectural constructs which propose the existence of space-time expedients that could connect obscure points in the universe, within the confines of general relativity. However, ‘such configurations require matter that violates the null energy condition' <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306357606_Traversable_Wormholes_via_a_Double_Trace_Deformation"><small><em> (Gao, Jafferis, Wall, submitted 2016 (v1), last revised 2019 (v3)</em></small></a> and this is where the speculation breeds another equally speculative one; the idea of exotic particles, sometimes known as exotic matter. Exotic matter consists of hypothetical particulates which have unique characteristics that are not apparent in normal matter. These properties frequently include negative energy density or negative mass, which deviate from the ordinary particle behaviour that is outlined by the Standard Model of Particle Physics which explains how the interaction of basic building blocks of matter is regulated by four fundamental forces: the strong force, the weak force, the electromagnetic force, and the gravitational force <a href="https://home.cern/science/physics/standard-model"><small><em>(CERN, 2023)</em></small></a>​. They also incorporate several hypothetical particles, such as: 
        <ul>
            <li>Magnetic monopoles (MMs), which was first discussed as a possibility by Pierre Curie in 1894 but only taken seriously by compeers after Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac mentioned the possibility again (in 1931) and is required by the Grand Unification theories in theoretical physics.</li>
            <li>Q-balls, which were predicted by supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model to be a coherent state of squarks, leptons and Higgs field.</li>
            <li>Nuclearites are known as Strange Quark Matter (SQM) being made up of approximately equal numbers of up, down, and strange quarks, and is surrounded by an electron cloud, forming a sort of atom. <a href="https://toc.library.ethz.ch/objects/pdf03/e01_978-0-12-814397-1_01.pdf"><small><em>(L'Annunziata, 2020)</em></small></a></li>
        </ul>
        All these atoms are said to be ‘produced only in the first instances of our Universe’ <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/116/1/012005/pdf"><small><em>(Giacomelli, 2008)​</em></small></a>, however the authenticity of this statement is contentious as it was mentioned in an article written over a decade ago which has only been cited by 12 others. Exotic matter is most prominently discussed in the consideration of theoretical wormholes where faster-than-light travel is possible. Now, the idea is that the exotic material will prevent the collapsing of the wormhole by stabilising it; the negative energy counteracting the gravitational forces which would otherwise completely crush the wormhole - keeping it open for just long enough so that material can escape. However, it should be noted that this notion of exotic particles is all hypothetical and not proven to exist.</p>
        <p>Published in 2016, there was a paper which reported the first ever traversable wormhole, one which did not have a prerequisite for it to be lined with exotic material. According to Harvard University's Daniel Jafferis and Ping Gao, alongside Stanford University's Aron Wall, the repellent energy that exists in the wormhole's throat can be generated from the exterior via a special quantum connection between the wormhole's two mouths. Supposedly, when the black holes are linked in just the correct way, material that falls into one black hole will move along the wormhole’s throat and escape via the connected black hole at another location – depending on certain conditions and events occurring in the outside universe. Extraordinarily, Jafferis, Gao, and Wall realized that their scenario is arithmetically equivalent to quantum teleportation, a process that can be displayed through laboratory experiments.</p>

        <h3><u>1.7 Counter Argument:</u></h3>
        <p>Considering that the idea of Hawking Radiation is one of the most renowned theories, in correlation to black holes, but it is yet to be proven to exist means that supporting the proposition that escape from black holes is unequivocally impossible is much more easy; since it appears that our Universe cannot regularly produce black holes smaller than approximately 2.5 solar masses. In turn, this means that finding really small and therefore hot black holes is very difficult <a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/space/what-is-hawking-radiation"><small><em>(Gunn, 2022)</em></small></a>  making Hawking Radiation practically impossible to prove. Due to the little knowledge which exists about black holes, it is easier to say escape from one is not worth considering – more so because all the theories supporting escape from these mysterious holes rebut extant laws of astronomy, and physics in general - as well as not being evidenced to be the truth. Moreover, the idea that the gravitational pull of a black hole being so immense that not even light can escape because all of it is forcefully dragged to the centre of the black hole <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/nasa-knows/what-is-a-black-hole-k4.html"><small><em>(Smith, 2015)</em></small></a> has already been confirmed by esteemed theoretical astronomists which substantiates the claim that evading a black hole is unattainable. This can be seen by observing the way other celestial objects act around a black hole, such as stars and gases, because in space, high-energy light is created when a black hole and star are in close proximity; light which cannot be seen by the human eye but with satellites and telescopes <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/nasa-knows/what-is-a-black-hole-k4.html"><small><em>(smith, 2015)</em></small></a>. Due to the force of gravity being so strong, it causes the fabric of space-time to curve abundantly so that any matter, or even particles of light, that comes within too close of a vicinity to it, gets caught in its well of gravitational force where it will struggle to escape till the black hole ceases to exist. The curvature of space-time also becomes so highly pronounced, due to the staggering concentration of mass packed densely in a space so small, which causes the gradient of gravitational force to become so steep that it is virtually impossible for anything to overcome it. Furthermore, our current understanding of physics, including the laws of conservation of energy, do not provide any mechanism with which we can counteract the formidable gravitational forces of a black hole and thus most say there is none; there is no currently known force with enough energy which can equilibrize the strength of a black hole’s gravity – not even light which travels at the most accelerated speed of all things known to prevail.</p>
        <p>Additionally, to an outside observer, it will seem as though time stops at the event horizon for a black hole, however, to the matter falling in it, it will not seem as such. This is because all physical signals ‘will get infinitely redshifted at the event horizon’ <a href="https://profoundphysics.com/why-time-slows-down-near-a-black-hole/"><small><em>(Hirvonen, 2023)</em></small></a> hence never going as far as to the observer due to a phenomenon formally known as gravitational time dilation. However, this is debatable as this information was written by someone who has self-taught themselves physics and does not seem to have been cited much, if at all. The event horizon plays a critical part in the discussion of escape from a black hole since it is said to be the theoretical boundary which introduces a one-way journey to the centre of the black hole – where the singularity lies. Due to all these reasons, and perhaps many more, majority may decide it is impossible for anything to escape a black hole. There is just more evidence against the idea than for it; or to put it more accurately, there is not enough research on the possibilities of escaping black holes being true.</p>

        <h3><u>Conclusion:</u></h3>
        <p>There is one topic mentioned in this essay which I believe makes the possibility of escape from a black hole very true and probable: Hawking Radiation, also referred to by the term ‘black hole evaporation’. Through my exhaustive research, I found that Hawking Radiation is supported by coalesced models of quantum mechanics in addition to general relativity. Though it is currently incredibly arduous to prove the existence of Hawking Radiation, considering it is difficult to even detect it, I believe with enough research and investigative efforts, theoretical physicists will finally be able to reverse the portrayal of black holes as infinitely imprisoning. Furthermore, the concept of Hawking Radiation introduces the validity of the information paradox which, if true, proves that the information that falls into the black hole is translated and transcribed in the form of light energy – which is then emitted from the mouth of the mysterious entity. Though many people consider ‘escape’ a physical and visual scheme, for example, escape from a black hole would be matter exiting the phenomenon in precisely the same form which in which it first entered, this is not entirely true. The term ‘escape’ is not bounded by any rules or prerequisites which limit the idea to be in certain configurations or constructs – escape can be in many forms. In the 1970s, it was dubbed that the faint light emitted from the black hole does not contain any information <a href="https://physics.mit.edu/news/has-the-black-hole-information-paradox-evaporated/"><small><em>(Collins, 2021)</em></small></a>, however, according to quantum mechanics that is impossible.</p>
        <p>Due to calculations and formulae formed by Don Page, a former student of the renowned Stephen Hawking, the data from the matter in the black hole correlates with the radiation meaning that maybe black holes are not the information destroyers they’ve always been falsely accused of being. Therefore, if you consider the possibility of the information paradox as positive - then yes, escape from a black hole is completely and utterly possible; in the form of information immersed into the radiation effused from the dark stellar body. Though it may not be in the conventional form in which many may deem as escape, it is escape nonetheless. In spite of that, it should be noted that many of the previously mentioned topics in this essay are primarily theoretical and do not have enough extensive research which is verifiable and as a consequence, the integrity of the research is highly up to debate and questioning. As black holes are still a very new and less researched area of physics and quantum theory, all research conducted, and evidence in relation, is very recent and perhaps supported considerably less – in comparison to other fields of research. Furthermore, as the economic support when it comes to researching black holes is not very lucrative, it is difficult to advance in knowledge when it comes to this branch of theoretical physics. Although, I do strongly believe that persisted studies and advancements in theoretical physics, and observational astronomy, shall prove to be critical in unravelling the enigmas of black holes and the profound impact they have on our comprehension of the universe.</p>

        <h3><u>Evaluation:</u></h3>
        <p>In completing my EPQ, I have expanded on my own knowledge on the topic of how black holes are formed and their nature. By appraising the manner in which black holes react and are formed and how this relates to their inability, or you could also say their ability, to offer sanction for escape domineered me into exploring paths of investigative research I would not otherwise consider – due to a lack of motivation as well as it not being any part of my curriculum at school. I have always had a heartfelt passion for any topic in relation to astronomy and completing this project drove me to take my passion further down into an academic sense and gave me the opportunity to delve deeper into the subject matter, where I otherwise would not have.</p>
        <p>Whilst executing this assignment, I found I was searching for a definite answer - either a yes or a no however, along the way, I had realised this does not always need to be the case. Considering the answer to this matter relies somewhat on subjectivity; it depends on whether you consider radiation and information containing light as something escaping or not. My ideas for the project did differentiate slightly, albeit all in the astronomy field, when I was initially planning because I was not 100% certain. I ended up finalising my decision on black holes as I felt my other ideas, such as researching paradoxes in space-time, were very vague and did not have enough research conducted for me to be able to write an academic essay on it, one which truly educates my audience. Furthermore, due to my long-standing passion for black holes it seemed like the best-case scenario as it would ensure I put my all into this essay.</p>
        <p>Now that my essay is complete, I do believe I have found the answer I had been searching for and that my aims have been achieved as I now know what many possible pathways escape from a blackhole is possible. I do believe I could have structured my essay slightly differently so that all the information flowed together concisely, perhaps going into more depth with certain topics mentioned – e.g. the information paradox. Although, considering the word count and the time frame given, I do believe it was important for me to cover multiple different topics with varying opportunities to provide my audience with as much knowledge as I could. If I were to be able to extend my project, I would definitely research and focus more on the information paradox and how the Page Curve works, alongside the Page calculations. Additionally, I would have kept more to the given deadlines - by my school – because I had struggled to start planning and producing my essay which had made me fall slightly behind on the write up. Since the research process was very different to the way I learn things at school, it was difficult for me to begin because there is a vast amount of information available online so it becomes rather overwhelming. However, as I was pushed outside my comfort zone, I believe I have effectively learnt how to research and collect significant pieces of information and by undertaking this assignment I have learnt how to correctly cite sources and reference; as well as writing a more academic style essay. Of the dissertation, the layout and formatting has been incredibly different to what I am used to so it has truly given me an insight into what is expected of a formal and more lengthier essay. This has been a very eye-opening experience and I have learnt many transferrable skills which will aid me in my future academia and career.</p>
